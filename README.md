# Discord-Memberlist-Scrappers
a bunch of python tools you can use to scrape a server members list and auto-export it into an excel sheet
in addition to the scrap scripts I added a match.py which can be used to cross examine 2 excel sheets and output the members who exsist in both servers 
# how to use ;) 
**1- Python:** Ensure that you have the latest Python version downloaded from python.org........
**2- Libraries:** Download the libraries used in the scripts by opening your Command Prompt and running:
`pip install websocket-client pandas openpyxl discum`.....
**3- Discord Token:**
 You need to use your Discord token to run these, as they function as 
self-bots. To maintain account safety, I recommend making an alt account
 and using that token instead of your main one.......
**4-Tutorial:** If you are confused about how to find your token, there are countless tutorials on YouTube. You can use this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUqSNoJ28aU........
**5-Configuration:** Before you run a script, open the file and add your Server ID and Channel ID. You can get these by enabling Developer Mode in Discord settings and right-clicking on the server logo or channel......

# Note on Accuracy
The accuracy of these scripts varies based on server size. The "small" 
script can capture 100% of members in smaller communities, but 
performance and quality may drop in servers with higher member counts. I
recommend using the smallest script available that fits your specific 
needs
